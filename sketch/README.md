# Sketch abstraction

A collection of ideas about abstracting P5 sketches to React components as naturally as possible. If done right, it could eventually become a PR to the [react-p5](https://npm.im/react-p5) library.

Ideas for how this would look like implemented are detailed on `ideas/`.  

Implementation will basically derive from reverse engineering from the ideal final product described by the collection of components, hooks and other abstractions conceptualized on that folder.
